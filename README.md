# chore

chore is an executor, environment, and management for scripts that help to
perform some routine operations.

Here is a short list of cool titles:

1. A Sometimes Better Management for Homebrew Scripts
2. Even Superheroes Wash Floors
3. Blazingly fast ðŸš€ script management

This tools is written mostly for me and going to be used by me. Maybe
eventually there would be a cool README with a link to wiki.
